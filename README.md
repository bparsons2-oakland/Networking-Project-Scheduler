# Networking-Project-Scheduler

-Download python 3.11
-Run the "event_schedule" code first, then run the "ClientSchedule" code right after (by pressing open with, and clicking python)
-Then a terminal should pop up asking for a password. Currently the password is "123". Enter that in, then the Scheduler will provide you with a list of options.

-Should be mostly self explanatory, but you can choose to make a new event, see all events, edit current events, delete events, or exit. 
-Once an event triggers, text will appear on the screen saying it started. 

-To turn off the server/client connection just exit out of both terminals.
